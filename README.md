# YouTube Background Playback

Xposed module: Enable background playback in YouTube - Now with YouTube Music support

## How to install
- Make sure your Xposed Framework and Installer are installed and working properly
- Compile with Android Studio/Gradle 
#### OR
- Grab correct .apk from releases tab on this very repo
  - You can also download .zip with unsigned, automatically built .apk from Actions tab (be aware, you can't install it on top of signed one)
- Install as any other .apk

All apks in **Releases** tab are signed with original keys... nothing changed/removed from original repo

## This fork remains as backup - it's exact same as original one and all credits should always go to PylerSM
###### I am just keeping it alive
